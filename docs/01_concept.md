Story:
Overall: there's an alien invasion happening in the present time zone.
The future invents a time machine to go back in time to stop an alien invasion. However, the past also invents a time machine and goes to the future.

Time Machine Creation:
  Past: "one of the people in magic school did a spell wrong and went to the future... and then a lot of people followed him into the future"
  Present: No time machine - there's an alien invasion happening.
  Future: the future wants to stop the alien invasion because the future is really bad - so they go back in time to fix the alien invasion.


Game Design:
* Level Design: Pre-Designed
* Tower Placement: anywhere "viable" except path 
* Mobs: Move from One side to the other, do not return (they escape)
